She is overcome with emotion by the sights and sensations. Another young woman is with her and they meet up with Rui and another lady. Rui appears to be enamoured with the priestess and is the one that has arranged this escape. He is evidently someone of importance, but the priestess doesn't seem to know exactly who he is. They show wooden plaques to get past the guards, and. enter a busy street festival. The priestess is amazed by the sights, sounds and smells. Rui goes and gets a bunch of street food for them to enjoy. His hair is getting into the carmel sauce, and the lady ties it back.
