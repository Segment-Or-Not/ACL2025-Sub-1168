Li Xiang's a Priestess of the Moon, basically trapped in a palace her whole life. She hates it. These priestesses are just pawns for the emperors, and no matter what, they're stuck with it. One day, some guy named Rui sneaks into her room—he's around her age, laid-back, and not scared at all. He asks her name, which is rare, and they end up chatting. He's shocked she's never been outside. He leaves, promising to come back, but Li Xiang's not really bothered. She just hopes he doesn't get caught, and kinda wishes she wasn't a priestess anymore. That what I got at least.
