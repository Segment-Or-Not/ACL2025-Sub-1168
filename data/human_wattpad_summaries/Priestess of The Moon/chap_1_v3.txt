About all the kingdoms in the East, from Tang kingdom, to Heian kingdom, and Goryeo kingdom, have something called the Priestess of the Moon. At times they go by different names but they all live similar lives bound by four rules. From all the books read, Priestesses can't change their fate as they are instruments to the Emperors of their kingdoms. Any attempt of escape from this fate is always futile and leads to more security. Li Xiang, is a priestess with this same fate. She lives in one big room in the palace, with tutors, advisors, and people saying whatever they could to help her future. She has never really experienced the freedom of going outside. One day a messenger comes to inform her about His Majesty and the council's later arrival. However, the messenger proceeds to request to enter her room which is unusual. She tries to scare him away by telling him he will be punished if he is caught, but that does not bother him. She lets him into her room where they have a conversation. He askes her if she has been outside the palace but she says she has not. The messenger whose name is Rui is amused by this. However, before leaving he promises to visit her again but she tells him not to, to which he insist. After he leaves she prays he will not be caught as she usually does for the people that come to visit her, but this time it feels different. Withal, she feels uneasy, wishing she is not a priestess.
