The story follows Lady Li Xiang who is a priestess in a palace and she despises her morning routine. Every day, maidservants undress and redress her, comb her hair and prepare her for the day. Even though she resents the process she has no choice because all the females in the emperors presence are expected to look presentable, even the modest priestesses. Her routine is interrupted one morning when Rui who is a familiar and close figure unexpectedly visits her by sneaking into her room through the veranda. 

Rui reminds her of a promise he made to return and she is shocked by his audacity. He expresses his desire to take her outside which she cant do because of her responsibilities as a priestess. But, Rui insists she should be safe and claims that he has powerful friends who could protect her. Although Li xiang is sceptical she starts to feel a strange pull towards the idea of freedom which is what Rui offers. 

As they carry on talking, Rui then reveals that he has some deeper connection to her fate but he remains mysterious about his true identity. He then reassures her that he will continue visiting despite her being reluctant. After his departure, Li xiang reflects on how her meeting with Rui caused/stirred unfamiliar emotions in her which was almost like an urge for something more than her controlled life even though she struggles to understand why she resists it.
