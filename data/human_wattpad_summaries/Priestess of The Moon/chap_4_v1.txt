After a royal court function, the princess changed her clothes and let her hair down, when suddenly there was a knock on the door. That was Lady Zhu Hua and a couple of others. One of them worked for the Imperial Archives. They discussed books and then wanted to go outside with the princess but she didn't want to go. They agreed to play a game of go (Chinese board game) and decide depending on who wins. The story ended ambiguously.
