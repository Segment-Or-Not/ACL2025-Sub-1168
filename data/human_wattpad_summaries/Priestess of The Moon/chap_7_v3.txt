It started with Li Xiang, a priestess, who was mesmerized by the garden. She saw how beautiful it was because it was her first time being outside. She always longed to be outside. She was wearing a veil and when they were far enough she parted it and talked with her friend, Zhu Sha. Zhu Sha assured her that Li Xiang could do anything and they would be there for her. Li Xiang cried her eyes out but told Zhu Sha to not say that she cried to Rui. Li Xisng felt so happy that's why she cried. Some time later her other friends arrive, Rui and Yang Jun. They are the ones who sneak the Priestess. Rui saw Li Xiang cry even tho she tried to hide it. But Rui suddenly gets shy by touching Li Xiang's cheeks. Then they started departing again to the stone entrance and saw some guards who were stationed. They showed their wooden board dictating their identity. They are so well known that they can even not show their board, Zhu Sha jokingly said. LI Xiang knows Rui is lying when she asks about his identitytity. When they reach outside the wall, Li Xiang saw gathering of people, it's her first time. She saw different people with their different outfits. She saw how happy people are. Suddenly, Rui saw many vendors and get some foods for his friends. While Rui is gone the three talk about him. They told Li Xiang how their friendship started and how Li Xiang was different from them. They were shocked when they saw Rui with food and scolded him. He gave it to them and ate the candied stick in Li Xiang's hand. Li Xiang tried to brush the strand of Rui's hair and she felt something. She feels happy being with them.
