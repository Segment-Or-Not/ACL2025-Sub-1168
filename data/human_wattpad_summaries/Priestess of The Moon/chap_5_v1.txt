Our protagonist is busy with many responsibilities in the days leading to an important Go Match, a meeting with an Emperor, a visit from about the succession of the Hu Clan,etc. Our character is given advice on playing Go from their maidservant, whos knowledge rivals the highest of ministers, teaching them to play a different style that would increase their chance of winning, even when the odds are against them.

 The main character is anxious as the match with Rui draws near, but it soon becomes evident that Rui is completely focused on the game, even at the expense of his health. The protagonist worries about Rui's health after the game, which he wins, after discovering that he gave up sleep to read on how to play Go (by the old masters).

Realizing the sacrifices Rui made for this, our character realizes that this is a true friend. Somebody who is persistent in helping them. They have a heartfelt moment where the MC opens up that Rui had "freed them" from whatever shackles binded them down.
