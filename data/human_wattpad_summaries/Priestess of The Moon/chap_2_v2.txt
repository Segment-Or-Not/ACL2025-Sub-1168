There was a beautiful priestess who had a luxurious life. She could have anything she wanted, only exception is she always had to ask the emperor. Also, she could not leave the Veranda. She had previously met a boy, but it had been awhile since she was able to see him. One day he popped up outside her window. Was he crazy?! He could easily get caught! Rui was his name and he is standing in my room risking it all. He wants me to go outside, I am not a stray cat I can't just freely leave the Veranda. He is very persuasive, should I give in? Should I explore what the outside world is like? Is it safe???
