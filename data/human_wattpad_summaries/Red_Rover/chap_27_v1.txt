Greg and Isla are standing outside Cabroni's mom's house, anxiously waiting to see if Cabroni, the werewolf who had tried to kill them, is inside. Greg is trying to stay calm, but Isla can't sit still. She's frustrated and wants to just go in and get it over with. Greg warns her against rushing in, but Isla ignores him, determined to confront whatever's inside. She crosses the street, knocks on the door, and when she finds it unlocked, she steps right in. Greg hesitates for a moment, stuck in indecision, but then, driven by worry, he runs after her.
When Greg gets to the door, something strange happens. He can't get in. The house seems to be pushing him away, almost as if it's rejecting him. From inside, he hears growls, crashes, and Isla shouting in Spanish. Panicking, Greg climbs up to the roof, desperate to find another way in. That's when Cabroni, in full werewolf form, bursts out of a window, and Greg ends up in a fight on the street.
The werewolf is massive and terrifying, but Greg, despite the danger, is tough and can heal quickly from injuries. He tries to distract Cabroni by throwing a stick, but it doesn't work the beast is focused entirely on him. Just then, Isla's voice calls out from the window. Greg looks up and sees her, but she's not alone. She's holding onto a terrified woman named Lily. Lily looks gravely injured, and Greg can sense death lingering around her. The situation is much worse than he thought.
