It's about Vix's journal personal entries which seems incoherent at times as the person seems to struggle with life . SHe talks about seven and Oreo and how everything can quickly fall apart . There is also Meg, who distrusts Oreo, always about struggles and survival and everyone hides things to one another . Meg hides Vix's phone and journal in their car because of Oreo's intentions. All about suspicion, confusion, struggle and survival as much as it's a bit complicated to get the bigger picture
