A group of survivors are texting with some people nearby. The messages are kind of aggressive, but one of them thinks meeting them could give them more info or resources. Someone else worries about the risks, but they're all considering it anyway. They talk about the possibility of having internet again and other ways the meeting could help. In the end, they agree to try it, though there's still some unease about what might go wrong. At least that's what I got.
