Hampton had come to Penelopes house to pick her up for a date. Penny was trying to fool her parents into thinking she was okay after an incident. Hampton and Penny got in the car and we're having a talk about what to do. They talked about going to the Farmers Market Moe's, Hampton enquired as to what Penny's favourite thing from the Market was and she told him Chocolate Covered Potato Chips. Hampton though they sounded ridiculous, but he said he would try one if Penny would tell him something about herself. Penny agreed but then instantly regretted it. When they arrived at Moe's they went straight to buy the Potato Chips from Ben. They also bought some sandwiches for later. Penny saw Mrs Doe, whom she hadn't seen since the night of the incident. This rattled Penny but then Hamptom came back which broke the tension but Penny was still rattled, even after telling Hampton she was fine
