Penny looks forward to Thanksgiving, even though it will be slightly different, because her grandma will come with her new boy-friend. It is in fact her grandma who phones Penny a lot and laughs while trying to remember the name of Penny's boyfriend Hampton. Let us find out more about it. Penny recalls her endorsement from Annie and high schools examples without saying to whom this piece of information concerns. She will call her friend Jess, and afterwards she will tell Dr. Yao, her counselor, and then she decides to give it a thought.

As the time of Turkey Day nears, she starts assisting her mother with the preparation of the shopping list, and that's when she sees the tense attitude her mother had been displaying. Somewhat angered by the thought of having dinner with Annie, whom she heavily disliked, Penny's mom bitterly decided to invite her and her mother over for dinner along with the family members. To her astonishment, Aunt Sandy Grande, with Hampton turned into ‘Market-boy' granny, embracing the newly settled Prescotts was also invited. All of a sudden Penny starts perceiving her parents' intentions and the political implications of Thanksgiving through a slight feeling of anxiety.
