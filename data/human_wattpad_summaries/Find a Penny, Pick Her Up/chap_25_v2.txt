During Thanksgiving dinner at the narrator's house, things get really tense. Jayden asks a question, but nobody answers him, and everyone seems uncomfortable. The awkwardness grows when Grandma suddenly tells Annie and her mom, Mrs. Prickett, to leave. Annie tries to apologize, saying she doesn't know why she made a mistake, but Grandma won't listen. Mrs. Prickett defends her daughter and argues with Grandma, which shocks everyone since nobody ever talks back to her. Mrs. Prickett explains that she did what she had to do to protect her job and Annie's future, but this makes the narrator's mom really angry. She stands up for her family like a fierce mom protecting her kids.

The narrator, Hampton, and Jess decide to leave because the house feels too tense. But as they're heading out, a man shows up at the door. He's tall and thin with tattoos and messy blond hair. It turns out he's Hampton's dad, Asher, who just got out of prison. Asher says he came to surprise his family and join Thanksgiving dinner, but nobody seems happy to see him. Hampton freezes, clearly upset, and his mom, Mrs. Prescott, tells Asher to leave.

Asher tries to act cheerful, saying he's been eating terrible prison food and was excited about Thanksgiving. But Hampton is angry and doesn't want to reconnect. Mrs. Prescott tries to get Asher to leave, but he won't. The tension grows even more when Asher keeps trying to talk to Hampton, but Hampton refuses to budge.
Family conflicts surface at Thanksgiving when Grandma forces Annie and Mrs. Prickett to leave after a heated argument. The situation intensifies with the unexpected arrival of Hampton's estranged father, Asher, recently out of prison and seeking reconciliation. Hampton, visibly distressed, rejects Asher and leaves with his brother, Jayden. The narrator, grappling with the night's revelations, begins to see Hampton's hidden struggles and realizes his seemingly perfect life is far more complicated than she ever imagined.

While all this is happening, Hampton quietly goes to his little brother, Jayden, and tells him it's time to leave. The narrator tries to check on Hampton, but he brushes her off. Outside, voices start getting louder as the argument continues. Hampton apologizes to the narrator's family for the disruption and quickly leaves with Jayden. They revealed so many secrets. 

After Hampton leaves, the narrator thinks about how she always thought he had a perfect life. She imagined him as a cool, confident guy who moved to their small town for a fresh start. But now, she realizes there's a lot more going on in his life than she knew. His family has big problems, and he's been keeping everything hidden. Jess, sipping a drink, sums it up perfectly by asking, “What's he hiding?”

The story ends with the narrator feeling confused and wondering how much more she doesn't know about Hampton or even other people in her life. The night was supposed to be about celebrating Thanksgiving, but it turned into a night full of family drama and secrets.
