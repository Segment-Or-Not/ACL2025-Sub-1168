Jess is sitting in her room when Justin calls her on the phone wanting to check in on her after seeing her with Annie and Hampton. She confronts him about why he is checking up on her and he says that he cares and that he still loves her. Penny had broken up with his after a difficult experience at a party, and because she doesn't feel deserving of love. 
It now flashes back to a party a few months ago where Penny is drinking with Heather and Annie. Justin gives her a hug and when Annie and Heather try and take her away for 'girl time' he warns her to be careful, especially with what she is drinking and with Annie. She comes back to the present and tells Justin that she has to get off the phone and hangs up on him. 

At school the next day she speaks to her friend Jess about the night before and Jess tells Penny that Justin wants her back. Penny says that she knows but that she has been pretty clear. She thought she had told Jess that she knew but seemingly hadnt told her. 

In the next few days Penny and Jess are sitting in the school communal area, she is noticing that Hampton and Justin are now at a table together and they sometimes talk. Jess is doing her art and they speak about what Jess wants to do with college and her art. Jess points out that Penny keeps looking over at Hampton and that she will submit her art portfolio if she speaks to Hampton. At that point Hampton looks over and meets her eye. Jess remembers that she and Hampton had been on tour together but had barely spoken since he started at her school. She leaves the room flustered by Jess' taunting, knowing that she will have to speak to Hampton in order for Jess to submit her artwork.
