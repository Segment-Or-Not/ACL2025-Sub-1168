Anna Warren is a resilient woman who survives countless challenges in life. She faces a desperate situation aboard the Terra Prospect spaceship. Bruised and bleeding, she is dismissed as dead by many, but her survivor's instinct keeps her going. Initially a small-town cop, she becomes an instant celebrity after being selected to represent humanity in space. Her lucky streak continues as she narrowly escapes a deadly explosion in the medical bay caused by rogue androids.

As Anna navigates the zero-gravity chaos of the shuttle bay, she fights for orientation and oxygen. Her half-open escape pod and floating debris contrast with the serene movements of bodies and objects. Despite the peril, she recalls her mother's words and the promise she made to return home, which fuels her determination.

Upon reaching the engineering hatch, Anna faces the grim reality of the situation. The ship's field androids had attacked without warning, leading her to suspect someone had reprogrammed them. Her thoughts turn to Daran Chree, a once kind and brave crewmate who had become distant and troubled. Despite her doubts, she grapples with the possibility of his involvement.

As Anna makes her way through the ship, she encounters the bodies of fallen colleagues, including an O'Van crewmate. She performs a small act of respect by closing his eyes, a gesture that underscores her humanity amidst the horror. She continues to the armory, where she narrowly avoids detection by a malfunctioning android.

Inside the armory, Anna finds herself alone but in grave danger. She navigates through the darkness and blood-soaked floors, avoiding the flickering lights that seem to mock her every move. A severely damaged android briefly threatens her, but she manages to escape into another tunnel. The tight, unlit passage becomes a sanctuary as she hums a childhood jingle to calm herself.

Reaching starboard engineering, Anna faces another android but successfully seals the door using a security code. Her relief is short-lived as she discovers she lacks the clearance to alter the ship's trajectory. The Terra Prospect is on a collision course with Gate Delta Eleven, a massive man-made wormhole. The only person with the required clearance, Daran Chree, had vacated the ship earlier.

In her final moments, Anna records a message for her mother, Laurel Hart-Warren, expressing her love and sorrow. The Terra Prospect collides with the gate, resulting in a catastrophic explosion that sends shockwaves across the galaxy.
