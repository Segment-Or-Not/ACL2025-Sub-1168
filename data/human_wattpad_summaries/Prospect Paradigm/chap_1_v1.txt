Anna got to represent the Terra Prospect in space. She was free falling in her escape pod and had to pull the failsafe release. With a little bit of luck, she was still alive. She had to reach for the hatch to survive, and once she unlocked the hatch, she entered the medical bay. Out of nowhere, androids started firing at the walls. These were programmed, so someone must've reprogrammed these to fire at them. Who? She thought about her crewmate Daran who had been acting funny, but convinced herself, not him. She took into unto herself to shut them down. She headed to the starboard engineering are of the ship to power down the androids remotely. On the way, she passed by a dead crewmate, O'van. Then, an android's arm-cannon was firing at her. She realized they were in the starboard enginnering room. She called for the security and dialed code 314. However, this level of clearence had been changed today by one individual, Daran and he evacuated Terra Prospect earlier today. With that, anna left a message for her mom and the whole place exploded as they collided with Gate Delta Eleven.
