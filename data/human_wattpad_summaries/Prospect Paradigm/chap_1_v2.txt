Anna Warrren finds herself in a damaged escape pod trying to survive on a space craft Terra Prospect after field androids were re programmed to kill the entire crew by firing rockets. They were on their way back to their system to help an injured colleague. She suspected Daran Chree to be involved as he had had a change of behavior recently but wasn't sure.
She is trying to get to engineering via maintenance tunnels and comes across a dead collogue of the species O'van that was trying to hide. She then made it to the armory where a recent battled had occurred but was set upon by a damaged android that noticed her and started to fire. luckily it was badly damaged and was firing into the floor but she was injured in the neck. She then made her way to starboard engineering where an android noticed her and started firing but she closed the hatch to shield her and was safe. She then interrogated the computer to find out where they were heading but found the access had been recently changed and she was locked out from making a lifesaving course correction. She found that the ship was on a collision course with a wormhole gate and access was recently restricted to Daran Chree confirming he had orchestrated the destruction of the ship and all those aboard. She made a last message to her mother Laurel Hart-Warren who she had promised she would return after this great adventure but it was no use. The ship crashed in to Gate Delta Eleven destroying both and everyone on board.
