Javier, a robot with the capacity to feel, aims to free Wendy who has been locked in a warehouse with other mechanized soldiers. His partner Mary is unwilling to let go of him, claiming he is endangering himself while alluding to a more risky situation. He does not listen to her arguments either and shows his strong will to proceed with the plan to save Wendy because he feels she is in danger and he worries about her.

Space within the warehouse causes Javier to ponder over his life, thinking that he has been treated as if he was a machine regardless of possessing head-like features. He sees many droids all of which are inactive, which clears him of any immediate danger. He follows the Wendy's signal to the basement of the warehouse where his energy gets cut off abruptly sending him into a flashback.

The flash back is one of the key moments where Mary who is now trying to save Javier from becoming a machine, in order to save someone she loves tragically, turned him, blame this sole event on Javier being turned into a robot fully.
