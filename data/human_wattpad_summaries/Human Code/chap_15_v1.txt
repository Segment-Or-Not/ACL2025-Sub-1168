Javier enters a large hall with numerous bots which are not turnes on. Their relationship is secret from the other humans and Mary has kept this from Javier also. The other doctors think Mary has done amazing work and are keen to learn more. Mary turns off Javier and 'reboots' him, but appears to have kept part of his brain for her for another use.
