This text is about a group containing Javi, Rory, Wendy and Will who are currently navigating a tense / violent confrontration on a rooftop which is revolving around humans and androids - specifically struggles with identities due to androids being designed to mimic human emotions.

Axe, the replica of Javi, is currently accusing Rory of being a liar and pins Rory to the ground whilst communicating with Mary through his computer. Wendy is clinging onto Javi and refusing him to leave however Javi insists that she has to be taken to safety by Will in fear for her life.

Through flashes of vision, Javi  has experiences moments from Axe's memories, which reveal that Rory, though claiming to be a victim, is more self-centered and responsible for many casualties. Javi realizes that Rory's motivations were selfish, and even tho he said he was seeking love, he was actually only seeking out power. Javi then reflected on his own role in the situation, admitting that he may not return from this fight and that, without Bionics, he will cease to exist.

Rory's internal conflict becomes quite clear when he pushes Axe off the rooftop, showing a softer side of him, he then reveals his desire to be real, something Javi also relates to. The two androids share a moment of understanding as Javi reflects on the human-like qualities embedded within them meanwhilst  Rory, in his sorrow, questions why they are so damaged, and Javi comforts him, explaining that they were designed to be human.
