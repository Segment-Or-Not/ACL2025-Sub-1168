The key characters I would say are Riley, Rafe, Arden. Other characters are Mrs Horton and Fawn who is Riley's friend, and the guy she fights who I'm assuming is the bad girl Tor Langin. Riley is the high witch who is a water witch, although the text says later on that she discovers a new power through a fight which is fire. Rate (who is I believe her love interest) arms glow and I'm assuming he can heal since he healed Riley. I can see a lot of tension between Riley and Rafe but also maybe Arden, so it might be a love triangle?!

The main locations are the catacombs which is an underground space that has wounded witches and Grans office where Riley has a confrontation with Mrs Horton.
