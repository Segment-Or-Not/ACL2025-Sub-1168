Following a devastating fight that left her house in ruins and her coven seriously injured, Riley, the recently appointed High Witch, must deal with the fallout. She treats the wounded with Arden as she muses over the enigmatic conclusion of an inexplicable agreement, and the archangels call Rafe away. Riley approaches Mrs. Horton, the witch who was supposed to take her position, in an attempt to find out why they are at odds, only to discover that it is because Mrs. Horton fears Riley isn't ready to take charge. In the middle of this, Riley surprises Mrs. Horton by learning that she has the unusual capacity to control both fire and water, a skill never before seen in witches. Mrs. Horton admits that Riley's destiny and her leadership are completely unwritten as she hesitantly conjures flames from her hand.
