This text centres around a High Witch named Riley. Despite having died she appears to be the leader (presumably in ghost form) of her coven of witches which has just emerged victorious from a battle with rival witches.

She talks to a Mrs Horton who she assumes doesn't like her but in actual fact Mrs Horton is able to help her piece together where she has gotten and how her Grandmother was instrumental in this. 

Mrs Horton feels that Riley is too inexperienced to be a High Witch. Riley was kept away from the coven as a young girl as her Gran knew she was destined to die but didn't want to mourn her as a High Witch in addition to just a grand daughter. At this point Riley realises her Gran did this out of love.

Before the passage ends, Riley tells Mrs Horton of how she battled Tor Langin. As their hands locked it felt like they were on fire. Her theory is that she might have inadvertently stolen her power to compliment her own water gift. Mrs Horton thinks this is highly unlikely as nobody had ever had more than one core manipulation but sure enough when Mrs Horton encourages Riley to summon fire she is able to do so.
