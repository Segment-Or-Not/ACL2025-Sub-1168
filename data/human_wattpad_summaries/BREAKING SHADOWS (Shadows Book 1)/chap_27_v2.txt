A woman, tired and injured, tries to open her eyes to take in her surroundings. She realizes she is bound, a witch unable to move herself. Her captor, Miss Langin, reveals to her that she had been stealing power from other witches as a revenge for her entire family losing theirs. That although it was difficult she managed to do so because of the witch, Riley's inexperience. Finally that death would find her soon due to damage to the brain. She wanted to do something. She connected to the angel bound to her, and summoned an incredible amount of power, that sent Miss Langin, or Tor, to the ground. Her accomplice, Mike, who was present there and was responsible for Riley's brain damage, cried out in worry, saying she wasn't worth it. Riley told them either she would be leaving or no one would. It seemed the thought she would be dying hadn't sunk in yet. She struggled with both her captors, even getting thrown out of the building in the process. There, she noticed that the dome created to protect Valestone, where they lived, prevented some witches from leaving. She was happy; her plan to reverse the dome magic so evil wouldn't get out had worked. Tor was stunned at her power. The two witches continued their struggle, till Tor fell back, screaming over her power that had been taken away. Then, Rafe, an accomplice of Riley's appeared, looking battered and bruised, much to her dismay. He ripped Tor's soul out, and disappeared again. Finally, with the imminent danger gone, the High Witch of the Obsidian Star gave up the fight, and let death claim her.
