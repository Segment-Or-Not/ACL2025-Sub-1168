A fellow named Kai is travelling through a deserted wasteland in his beloved rugged Jeep in search of fuel to keep the vehicle going. He comes upon an abandoned hardware store and starts to explore inside looking for something useful. He discovers that he is not the first to sift through the items on the shelves, and is surprised when he comes upon a girl and her small companion who are in hiding in the store. She tries to warn him that it is a dangerous place as it is gang territory. Scary gang members appear and he is able to trick them, and he and the two squatters he discovered are able to escape.
