It leads up to a steamy, sensual encounter between two characters, Teagan and the narrator in his apartment. The ever-punctual Teagan gets there two minutes prior to the meet-up. Against the casual affair they had engaged themselves with, he was too hyped on seeing her at that moment. She comes in and looks provokingly good in her expensive sloppy oversized tee dress and tells him they need to get going soon. They waste no more time; the heat rapidly turns into fierce and passionate arousal.

He's proud, knowing he dominates Teagan and satisfies her almost as if this were some sort of competitive sport. The detailed internal monologue focuses on technique and control in an effort to prove his prowess at giving pleasure. The narrative is an exploration of their dynamic-power, pleasure, and rush of shared intimacy.

When the session is finally over, at 8:04, well under five and a half minutes, if the narrator does say so himself, Teagan leaves looking quite pleased, booking another appointment. Now left to himself, he feels quite good, feeling excited with their budding connection. A text from his father gets him back in reality and the not-so-lighter aspects of his life.

This story represents the themes of desire, dominance, and ephemeral satisfaction in a casual sexual relationship; it shows physical closeness and emotional distance.
