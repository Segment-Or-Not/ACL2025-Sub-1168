The narrator, Blaire wakes up to a text on her phone notifying her that a book she's been wanting to read , The Key to Anchor Lake, is now available at her library, Anchor Lake. Although Blaire can't wait to pick up the book, she chooses to have her breakfast with Elizabeth, her aunt, who is described as enigmatic. Blaire is not sure what Elizabeth does at her upstairs room, maybe it's painting or watching birds. So, after breakfast, Blaire heads over to the library, having lied to Elizabeth that she is going to meet up with some friends. Her reason for lying is because Elizabeth would not allow her to read the mysterious book. Blaire gets the book from Regina at the library and heads to a cafe where her friend, Sukie, works. She orders coffee and holds onto it until it's ice-cold consumed in the book which doesn't give her the answers she wants. Suki comes to refill her cup and they engage in a critical evaluation of the book. They explore the ideas that Mary, who authored the book, concentrated on, especially events and names, leading the two to uncover a pattern. Later, after Sukie is called on by a co-worker, Blaire is left wondering how to solve the Mary's cryptic message. The story within a story ends with a frustrated Blaire having not uncovered the truth hidden in the book 'The Key to Anchor Lake'.
