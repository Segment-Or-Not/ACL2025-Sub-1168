Blaire reflects on the loss of her mother, who died in March, and how it's surreal living through April without her. She remembers their shared love of Taylor Swift's music and the emotional impact of the song Soon You'll Get Better. One day, Blaire heads out to the café, feeling more at home with Elizabeth, who has begun to trust her more. At the café, Blaire learns that Niko and Cat have been a couple for two years, and she discusses The Key to Anchor Lake with them, sharing a new theory about the book. When Blaire realizes that two characters' names are anagrams, it sparks a revelation: Mary S. Nesbitt and Betsy Martins are the same person, and the mystery around Mary is solved.
