Blaire Bloxham receives an exciting text from the Anchor Lake Library, informing her that a coveted book, The Key to Anchor Lake by Mary S. Nesbitt, is available for her to check out. Although eager, Blaire pauses to have lunch with her aunt, Elizabeth, before cycling to the library. Regina Hart, the librarian, gives Blaire the book, which is old and battered but full of mysteries Blaire has been eager to explore.

Blaire heads to Sukie's café to read the book, as Sukie has been part of a book club deeply analyzing its contents. Blaire quickly notices discrepancies between the group's theories and what Mary actually wrote. Contrary to the popular belief that the book outlines a cyclical 25-year disaster pattern in Anchor Lake, Blaire discovers that the focus is not on the timeline but on the people involved in the events.

Sukie is initially distraught upon realizing she misinterpreted the book but becomes determined to unravel the mystery. Blaire points out recurring mentions of specific individuals, such as Betsy Martins, and theorizes that Mary's cryptic question, “Who next?”, is about identifying people rather than predicting events.

The story ends with Blaire engrossed in her third read-through of the book, meticulously noting names and dates to uncover the true meaning of Mary's work. Despite the unresolved mystery, Blaire feels a renewed sense of purpose and connection with Sukie.

Key characters include Blaire, her aunt Elizabeth, Sukie (the café owner), and Regina Hart (the librarian). The main locations are the Anchor Lake Library and Sukie's café. The central theme revolves around unraveling the enigmatic narrative of The Key to Anchor Lake.
