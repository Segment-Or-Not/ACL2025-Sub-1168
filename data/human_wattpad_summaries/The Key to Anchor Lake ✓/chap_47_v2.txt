The text above is about a woman named Blaire. Blaire seems to be in her early twenties and she lives with her sister Elizabeth in their family home after their mother passed away a few months earlier. Blaire lives in a small town and has feelings for another girl Sukie who works at the local coffee shop. Blaire leaves the house to go to the coffee shop and pick up some things for Elizabeth to cook for dinner. 

Upon arriving at the coffee shop, Blaire runs into two of her friends, Niko and Cat who are a couple. She looks around for Sukie but doesn't see her so she sits with Niko and Cat. They discuss Niko and Cat's origin story and then a podcast and book that everyone seems to be following together. Niko and Cat point out that Sukie is at another table talking to Oli, a 20 year old who got Sukie pregnant and then left the area. 

Blaire, Niko and Cat discuss theories about the book and Blaire discovers that two names from the book are anagrams and are actually the same person. Upon discovering this, Sukie comes over to their table and joins the discussion about the just discovered new information from the book.
