Friends Rex, Zidan, Ramses, and their new companion Calliope, have been brought together by the archaelogical discovery of a parchment and mask (now with Dimitri) and are now on a ferry headed to Spain. As they eat, they discuss what has happened and plan for the next steps. Calliope cops to her lies to the group and reveals her concerns about her missing colleague, Niko Kostas and the artefact that may have made him go missing.  The group shares knowledge and, based on their understanding of ancient Greek philosophers, realizes that they may be on the trail of not just Niko, but the lost city of Atlantis.
