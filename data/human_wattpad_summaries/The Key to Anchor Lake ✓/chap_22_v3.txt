Rex is leading a ferry on a journey following a piece of parchment paper. After heading to the galley, Rex and the rest of the group (Dimitri, Zidan, Ramses) get acquainted with Calliope who faked her identity earlier to the crew. After explaining why she lied Calliope notes she needs Rex's help. Calliope and Rex discuss the mutual friend Niko who was startled by the parchment. Rex and Calliope continue to go back and forth on why they are going to the Spanish coast only to note it is home to Cadiz. Rex goes into detail about the history of Cadiz. Calliope continues Rex's points and brings out a metal case with the parchment who she believes belonged to Greek philosopher Crantor. Crantor supposedly visited Egypt and wrote of a civilization called the Pillars of Hercules which is responsible for many of the advancements in todays world. Rex continues on to confirm it is the lost city of Atlantis that they are trying to find.
