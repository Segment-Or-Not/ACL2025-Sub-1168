Blaire rides on to Elizabeth's house, anxious about facing her aunt. She knows there's things to be said and issues to be resolved, but she wavers. Suki, the daughter of the woman in who's car she arrives, gives her assurance that she would be able to handle it, and that she could call on her if she needed an escape. With this at the back of her mind, Blaire makes up her mind and finally, enters the house. She finds Elizabeth in the room she spends most of her time, and lets her presence known before she loses the resolve she'd built up before. Elizabeth doesn't make a fuss, and Blaire notices that she cared enough to remember how she liked the coffee she was offering for them to talk over. Blaire goes straight to the point and asks why Elizabeth has a picture of her even though she claimed she hadn't known her much earlier. Though shaken up by it, Elizabeth steels herself and brings a photo album of which she uses to tell Blaire of the girl in the photo, not Blaire, but her dead daughter Fee. Blaire feels regret over her actions as Elizabeth continued to tell her of how she'd always wanted to be a mother. She regretted the things she'd said when she hadn't known Elizabeth's side of the story, the kind woman in front of her which she just had to confront with her daughter's death. She tried to apologize, feeling like her apologies wouldn't be enough to cover up what she'd done. Elizabeth hugs her, and she closes her eyes, listening to the steady heartbeat that tells her everything is okay.
