This story details a short yet potentially life-altering series of events following a disastrous debate performance and its aftermath to the psyche of one Rose Matthews.

Wallowing in her misery does not play well with her solitude and so, in what I can only assume to be quintessential youthful defiance, fabricates a story for her parents and heads to go see Blake in his basement. They initially seem to be friends - ex partners that made it work as friends, perhaps - but that illusion is broken as we are let in to Rose's inner monologue, followed by outright dialogue between the two.

A quick foray into Blake's backyard in his attempt to help her vent the frustrations of the day in the form of a sledgehammer and some wood is soon interrupted by a group of their friends who we can assume live in the space above the basement. 

The five of them decide that it is time to have a swim and as they approach and have a seat on the railing she is convinced by Freddie that jumping will do wonders for her. She reluctantly agrees, and with the newfound confidence her session with the hammer gave her and the freedom of the jump, we are left to ponder what futures her newfound freedom might grant her.
