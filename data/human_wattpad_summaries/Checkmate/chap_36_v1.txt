Rose has a debate at school against Chase and she feels that she did terribly. At home, she doesn't want to talk about it so she tells her parents she is going to a girl friend's place but goes to see Blake though she has reservations about it.  Once there, she tells him she just wants to sit and watch TV while Blake fiddles with his vape.  She allows him to smoke, though in the past, she hasn't wanted him to.  As they spend a few minutes together she allows her feelings for him to surface though she doesn't tell him about it.  Blake knows she is being hard on herself and takes her outside to the woodpile where he gives her a sledgehammer to let out her anger and frustrations.  After guiding her, she goes all out, yelling and swinging and getting releasing her frustrations.  Friends next door her the commotion and come out to see what is going on.  After the they discuss what has happened, one of them suggests they go jump off the neighborhood bridge.  Once there, Rose still is in tune with Blake and Freddie suggests she should just tell him how she feels because he won't say anything.  After a bit, Freddie and Rose jump off the bridge into the water and Rose feels free for the first time that night.
