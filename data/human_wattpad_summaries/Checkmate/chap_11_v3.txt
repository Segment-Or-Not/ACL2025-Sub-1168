This passage is about a mayors daughter, Rose. She is trying to win a campaign, and has hired a team of people to help her win it. However, she overhears everyone except for Liv talking shit about her and is disheartened by this and turns to leave.  Blake, hearing her leaving, convinces her to stay and join them. After joining them, Rose suggests they continue their meeting, and proposes that her campaign should be on something that affects all kinds of people - bullying. She asks the room for their opinions, and they spend over an hour researching and coming up with ideas for the campaign. Afterwards, its only Blake and Rose left in the room. Blake brings up the issue that she no longer has her old friends to win her votes, so she'll need to make new ones, in which Blake suggests she should appear at a party the day after so she can mingle and allow people to get to know her more. After some convincing from Blake, she decides she will attend the party, and the extract ends with her leaving before Blake says something that makes her regret her decision.
