he story intertwines two narratives. In one, high schoolers Vidya and Amber collaborate on a pour-painting project in a quiet art room, discussing college plans and the antics of a mysterious prankster called "The Jailer." Their day is interrupted by an anti-bullying assembly triggered by The Jailer's latest prank, prompting Vidya to reflect on human nature and her own beliefs about goodness.

The other narrative follows Juggernaut, a leader in the superhero organization Celestro, as he investigates a string of mysterious murders targeting superheroes. The victims—Achilles, Fairy, and now Fade—are killed in gruesome ways, undermining Celestro's reputation. Juggernaut confronts the possibility that internal negligence contributed to these deaths, particularly with Fade's demise in a gasoline-soaked warehouse explosion caused by a teammate.

Seeking to reassert Celestro's dominance, Juggernaut targets Speed, a rival hero who betrayed him years earlier. Visiting Speed's British-themed Los Angeles apartment, Juggernaut confronts him. Overconfident in his super-speed, Speed mocks Juggernaut but is blindsided when Juggernaut uses his laser vision to sever Speed's legs and then decapitates him. Juggernaut stages the scene to appear as part of the ongoing murders and leaves unnoticed, reflecting on his actions as he discards Speed's teacup over the ocean.

The narratives explore themes of morality, power dynamics, and the consequences of human and superhuman actions. Key locations include the high school art room, the Celestro intelligence room, a crime-ridden warehouse, and Speed's apartment.
