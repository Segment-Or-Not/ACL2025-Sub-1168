This seems to be a story about a group of friends - longtime, reluctant, or somewhere in between - who have found themselves in a battle against demons. The reasons for this have been omitted but seem to be irrelevant to the situation; this is not the end of their story but it certainly is not the beginning.

A man (kid) named Archer is obviously the most powerful of the group in battle, but it is uncertain whether he is their leader. Before he showed up in the story, the team fought courageously but were on the verge of exhaustion. His presence tipped the balance of power in whatever arena they found themselves in. A school? An abandoned warehouse ("large, unfinished room")?

My primary interest here, aside from Archer, is the dynamic between Felix and who is described as his sister, May. The fact that she is recorded as "leaving his mind" begs many questions for me as a fan of this sort of genre. Is she dead? Has she been subject to some sort of nullification that leaves her trapped in a dimension millimeters away yet incomprehensibly unreachable?

These are the questions, when I read things like this, that I ask myself and that keep me coming back for the next chapter. Then again this could have already been explained as we the readers seem to have been thrust into this somewhere in the middle.
