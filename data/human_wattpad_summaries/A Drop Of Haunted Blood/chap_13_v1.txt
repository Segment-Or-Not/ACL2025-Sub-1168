Felix, now a body of water at the behest of his sister May, joined Arisa and Mason in a hall against a tide of demons. Using holy water to burn the demons, after a very intense fight, they overcame their enemies temporarily. A huge, red demon bursts through the ceiling and then suddenly attacks Felix and his friends. They fought back in exhaustion, Mason using his dagger and Arisa using protective sigils.

They fight, but they are clearly outnumbered; just then, a mysterious warrior named Archer appears and dispatches the remaining demons with his incredible fighting skills, including magical abilities that include poison. Felix, Arisa, and Mason stare at him in amazement. Archer targets Mason first, whom he perceives to be an enemy-a demon-but Felix manages to clear things up: Mason was forcefully changed into a demon and has kept being their ally.

A paralyzed demon who survives warns them that Mason will inevitably fall to bloodlust, as it happens with all humans infected with demon blood. Archer interrogates the demon about the unusually large number of demons present, but the creature speaks vaguely and tries to bargain for his life. When it mentions Archer's tragic past and fallen friends, Archer doesn't hesitate to kill the demon. The group prepares themselves, yet still wary, for what's in store as Archer asks after Sebastian.
