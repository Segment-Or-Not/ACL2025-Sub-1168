Felix, Mason, and Arisa found themselves in a desperate battle for survival against a pack of powerful werewolves. Despite their valiant efforts, they were vastly outnumbered and outmatched. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, their teacher Sebastian burst onto the scene, his arrival a timely turning point in the battle.
Sebastian's intervention proved decisive, as he unleashed his magical powers and fired special silver bullets to devastating effect. The werewolves, taken aback by Sebastian's sudden appearance and formidable abilities, were quickly routed. As the dust settled, Felix, Mason, and Arisa breathed a collective sigh of relief, grateful to have emerged victorious from the fray.
As they caught their breath, Sebastian tended to their wounds, using his knowledge of healing magic to stabilize their injuries. The trio was badly hurt, but Sebastian's prompt medical attention helped prevent their conditions from deteriorating further.
Once they had recovered sufficiently, Sebastian revealed to them that the werewolves they had just fought were, in fact, members of a legendary group known as the Supermoon Wolves. This revelation sparked a mixture of shock, awe, and trepidation among the trio, as they struggled to comprehend the enormity of what they had just faced.
Sebastian further disclosed that Ernest, a supposed ally and fellow Guardian, had secretly collaborated with the werewolves. Ernest's treachery had enabled the werewolves to launch a surprise attack on Felix, Mason, and Arisa, catching them off guard and unprepared.
As the sun began to rise, the werewolves' lifeless bodies started to transform back into their human forms. One of the women, still clinging to life, revealed to Sebastian her connection to Mira, the enigmatic leader of the Last Army. This revelation sent shockwaves through the group, as they realized that they had stumbled into something much larger and more complex than they had initially anticipated.
Arisa, determined to prevent the woman from divulging any further sensitive information, silenced her permanently. Sebastian then took the opportunity to explain to the trio that Mira's group, the Last Army, was thought to have been defeated. However, it now appeared that this was not the case, and that Mira's organization remained a potent force, pulling the strings from behind the scenes.
Sebastian also dropped a bombshell, revealing that Felix's family had been killed by someone working for Mira. This stunning revelation left Felix reeling, as he struggled to come to terms with the fact that his family's death was not a random act of violence, but rather a deliberate and premeditated act of murder.
As the group digested this new information, they realized that they had traitors in their midst, including Ernest. This sobering realization left them with a sense of unease and vulnerability, as they wondered who else might be working against them.
Despite the challenges and dangers that lay ahead, Sebastian, Felix, Mason, and Arisa steeled themselves for the battles to come. They knew that they had to be vigilant and proactive, using their combined skills and strengths to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. With a newfound sense of determination and purpose, they set off towards an uncertain future, ready to face whatever challenges lay in store for them.
