A group of seven student magic users, Jack, Rose, Clara, Mason, Felix, Arisa,  and Noah are brought by their teachers, Archer and Kendraa to an abandoned house in the woods. The students are told to wait outside while the adults check out the house. 

While they wait Jack decides to enter the house as well - joined by Clara Noah and Rose, while Mason, Arisa and Felix admonish them and remain outside as instructed. Soon the three students outside hear a scream from the house and after a short discussion rush in to help. Inside they find the other four students - one unconscious trapped in a room by a Wraith, an evil creature that will drain your life force if it gets close to you. 

Mason and Felix proceed to use their hellfire powers to assault the wraith while Arisa )and the undescribed Clementine) distract it. After successfully defeating the Wraith the students head back outside where they are met by their oblivious teachers. After everyone is brought up to speed they begin to discuss how to avoid being taken by surprise in the future.
