A group of people are camping in the country, they have a leader called archer. On waking, they pack up camp and go to find a house which has been exorcised. We learn they are looking to get rid of the ghosts/demons. Two of them enter the house as they can hear the spirits, but the less experienced remain outside. It's safer outside. 2 decide to follow in, but the others hear a scream and go to find them even tho they are scared. They find a wraith, a super scary and violent poltergeist and a fight breaks out. Felix finally breathes fire to kill the wraith and they find out he is a demon. The reader then learns they are all witches.
