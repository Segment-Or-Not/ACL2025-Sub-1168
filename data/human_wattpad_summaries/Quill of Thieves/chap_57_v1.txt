Matthias gets super worked up after Abel calls him out for being shady, and they almost fight. She's figured out he's been hiding stuff, like knowing about portals and working with the fae. They argue a bit, and then it comes out that Abel might be part elf. Matthias tries to explain the whole magical history, how kids from different magical races were hidden away during the Purge to survive, and Abel starts to piece together how she ended up in Eilibir through a portal. Things get tense, but Matthias basically drags her along, telling her they're going to get answers together. They leave the room, with Abel still cursing him under her breath. Something like that.
