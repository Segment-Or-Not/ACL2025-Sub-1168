This is a story from the perspective of the protagonist named Astrid who is the daughter of the Queen Davina. She had found a boy who had control of the seven elemental threads, making him an "Author" similar to the boy. His powers had recently drained and nearly killed his partner name Abel whom she healed. To find out more about the boy she travels to Treason's Tower, a jail inside of a mountain where several prisoners are being held, including a tongueless scribe named Serah. To coerce her into giving up information she threatens to kill another prisoner named Zev, Serah reluctantly gives the word, "Voíxili". Astrid looks for the word in a poorly translated book. Failing to do so, she hopes the boy will be able to translate the epitaph.
