Lazarus' crew made their way around the waterlogged ruins and approahced the Crystal tower which was this massive skyscraper. Here, Erin was recalling childhood memories from when she had previously visited the tower with her family and compared its previous grandeur to its current dilapidated state. The group decided to enter the building, receiving help from 2 shop mannequins who were dressed quite interestingly - a mix of human and improvised attire.

Eventually they reached the penthouse which was fortified with baricades made up of broken furniture pieces, this penthouse was filled with mannequins which were all armed. The center of this penthouse had the blue king on a throne of salvaged office equipment and behind him stood Harunara who was a golden-skinned chief warrior.

The group proceeded to introduce themself to the Blue King and the group delivered their message of alliance and returned a dog to the blue king. The king then called for an elevator which is suggested to lead into the "very bottom of the endless blue"
