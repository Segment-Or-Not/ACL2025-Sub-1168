This story is talking about Sukie being worried and Blaire meeting with Suki's friends at a grave site I presume. Blaire doesn't want to see Jacob and seems to be burdened since a hug helped to make her less burdened. So then they leave to go to Elizabeth's house and Blaire tells a story of being mad at Jacob and Olli if that's his name and is prideful for yelling or considering them as evil or "weasel" like. I think someone died and someone might be lesbian based on the closeness of women or I don't know if they are romantically involved and if it's a male or female group together because females can have male names. But I guess someone's grieving and pregnant too and they seem really close and friendly and things seem mundane.
