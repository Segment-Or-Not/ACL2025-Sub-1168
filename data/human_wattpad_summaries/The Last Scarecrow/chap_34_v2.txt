Marshall, also known as The Blue King, shares his story with Erin, a young girl searching for her brother. Marshall survived the catastrophic event known as The Many Years Storm by hiding in a cloakroom with his dog, Socks. He discovered that mannequins, once human-like store displays, had come to life and were killing humans.
To avoid being killed, Marshall disguised himself in a blue biker outfit and helmet, which led the mannequins to believe he was one of them. Their leader, Harunara, declared Marshall "The Blue King" and had the mannequins build him a courtroom and throne.
Marshall reveals that he's been trapped in this role, feared and worshipped by the mannequins. He's been using a secret room on Level 3 of The Crystal Tower as a sanctuary. Recently, Harunara and the mannequins have been acting suspiciously, making Marshall fear for his safety.
Erin, determined to help Marshall escape, decides that it's time for "The Blue King" to reign no more. With newfound resolve, Erin is ready to face the challenges ahead and find her brother.
