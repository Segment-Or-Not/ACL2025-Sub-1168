In the shadowy depths of the HMS Fortitude, two key characters—Twelve and Erin—set out to explore the abandoned warship, accompanied by Erin's loyal blackbird, Raven. The atmosphere is thick with mystery as they make their way through dark passageways, uncovering remnants of the past, such as personal belongings and dwindling food supplies. They stumble upon a gas stove, and with a flick, Erin manages to ignite it, flooding the gloomy kitchen with light and revealing more hidden treasures.

However, the tension escalates when they encounter a severely injured sailor. Bloodied and desperate, he warns them about "Boot Hill" and a fearsome figure called the "Patchwork Woman." His urgent warnings hint at dark powers that threaten their safety, but just as he begins to elaborate, he collapses in front of them, leaving Erin and Twelve shaken.

Erin becomes increasingly curious about why the sailor referred to her as a "human girl." As she searches his pockets, she finds a service revolver. Despite Twelve's firm objections, she insists on taking it, feeling a strange sense of empowerment and determination to embrace her new role as a survivor and warrior.

With their supplies gathered, Twelve hurries Erin back to the deck, where they prepare to leave the haunting ship behind. They climb aboard a small boat called Lazarus, ready to venture out into the unknown. As they set out to sea, Twelve encourages Raven to tell them more about Boot Hill. Though hesitant, he describes it as a dreadful graveyard filled with death and decay, warning them strongly to avoid it.

Faced with the grim reality of their situation, the trio shifts their focus and decides to head for the "Island of Trees" instead, navigating by the North Star. As the sun sets, casting a warm glow on the waves, they prepare to confront whatever challenges lie ahead, bound together by their shared experience and a growing sense of determination. United in their quest, Erin, Twelve, and Raven venture into the uncertain future, ready to uncover the secrets hidden in the darkness and discover the truths that lie beyond their harrowing encounter.
