Lazarus, Socks the dog, Erin, Twelve the scarecrow, and Jack the Wickerman enter a large sky-scraper like fortress with mannequin guards holding weapons. Once inside, they find themselves inside of an old office-like room, and venture forward where several rows of mannequin guards are standing at attention near their leader, the Blue King, who rules over the Scrapers and the endless blue. The Blue King is dressed like a biker, and a shimmering golden mannequin stands near the Blue King as he inquires as to who and what they are, eventually revealing that their dog , socks, belongs to him. The group says that they came to declare Bavorski Beetlestone's message of allegiance to the king, but soon afterwards he tells his mannequin minions to prepare the elevator for them, to take them to the bottom of the endless blue over which he holds dominion.
