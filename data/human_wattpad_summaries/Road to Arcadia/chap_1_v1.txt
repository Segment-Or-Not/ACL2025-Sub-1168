The passage above describes how this sort of infection, known as the Redding, causes red spots to appear on one's skin, turning them into animalistic, violent creatures. Their little community has one member, Patrick, who carries this sickness, and his body becomes rapidly engulfed with huge red splotches. He's been hiding that his condition is worsening because he's afraid the group will shun or kill him, especially after his half-brother pushed him off a bridge for thinking he was turning into a zombie. Patrick is anxious, as one would be, because he's afraid of being left behind; the narrator reassures him that they're a team and won't hurt him.

It soon becomes apparent that Patrick, like the narrator, is apparently immune to the Redding as neither of them has shown the effects of the infection, despite the severity of the patches. This is where his immunity could mean there is a chance that other members of the group are resistant too, therefore offering a glimmer of hope for their survival. Calico J is a close friend of Patrick's and regrets her actions that might have driven Patrick further inside his shell; she comforts him when Patrick shares his fear and past trauma.

Later, Ditzy, one of the survivors, regains her confidence after a traumatic encounter with the Redding. The group moves up a hill to assess their surroundings and realize the river that was once filled with dangerous Redding is now calm. However, they are not overconfident; they know the lurking dangers. Ditzy jokingly says they should attack more enemies, but the narrator stresses that a new and careful plan is needed. This passage underlines the growing camaraderie among the group of people and their joint struggle for survival in a no-man's land infested with the Redding infection.
